"""WSGI middleware to allow returning a string or Response object.

The request side of WSGI--the "commons" of the environ mapping--is quite
nice. It honors the tradition of CGI, and it's just a mapping. Simple.

The response-side API is a little stiffer, because WSGI has to support edge
cases like serving large files, complex exception handling, and HTTP/1.1
features. This results in warts like start_response, and the requirement
that apps return an iterable. The intention is that these warts be smoothed
over at other layers, and that's what we're doing here.

Apps below this shim may speak plain WSGI, but they may also return a
string, which will be sent back as text/html. They may also return or raise
a Response object.
