1.0a1 -- November 7, 2006
=========================

    This is the first public release of mode.py. It started life over a year
    ago, in version 0.6 of httpy. I'm factoring it out in preparation for a new
    version of httpy.

    After mode.py's API has undergone scrutiny and I'm satisfied that it is
    stable, I will release 1.0b1. When I'm satisfied that mode.py is both stable
    and bug-free, I'll cut a 1.0 maintenance branch, and will release 1.0.0 from
    that.
