"""Model the life-cycle of an application as a series of four modes.

It is often valuable to maintain a distinction between various phases of an
application's lifecycle. This module calls these phases "modes," and identifies
four of them, given here in conceptual life-cycle order:

    debugging       The application is being actively debugged; exceptions
                      may trigger an interactive debugger.

    development     The application is being actively developed; however,
                      exceptions should not trigger interactive debugging.

    staging         The application is deployed in a mock-production
                      environment.

    production      The application is in live use by its end users.


The expectation is that various aspects of the application -- logging, exception
handling, data sourcing -- will adapt to the current mode. The mode is set in
the PYTHONMODE environment variable. This module provides API for interacting
with this variable. If PYTHONMODE is unset, it will be set to development when
this module is imported.

Functions

    get     Return the current PYTHONMODE setting as a lowercase string; will
              raise EnvironmentError if the (case-insensitive) setting is not
              one of debugging, development, staging, or production.

    set     Given a mode, set the PYTHONMODE environment variable and refresh
              the module's boolean members. If given a bad mode, ValueError is
              raised.

    setAPI  Refresh the module's boolean members. Call this if you ever change
              PYTHONPATH directly in the os.environ mapping.

Members

    The module defines a number of boolean attributes reflecting the current
    mode setting, including abbreviations and combinations. Uppercase versions
    of each of the following are also defined (e.g., DEBUGGING).

        Name                        True if PYTHONMODE is set to ...

        staging_or_production       staging or production
        stprod                      staging or production


Example usage:

    >>> import mode
    >>> mode.set('development')     # can set the mode at runtime
    >>> mode.get()                  # and access the current mode
    'development'
    >>> mode.development            # module defines boolean constants
    True
    >>> mode.PRODUCTION             # uppercase versions are also defined
    False
    >>> mode.dev                    # as are abbreviations
    True
    >>> mode.DEBDEV, mode.stprod    # and combinations
    (True, False)
