"""Steps to do a release (automate eventually).

We could automate the version sweep with a ~~VERSION~~ token and find|sed, but
we'd have to watch underlines in HISTORY (would work for 1.0a1 -> 9.9a9).

While releasing, track updates to this doc in a tmp file, and then change the
doc on trunk/ again after the release is done.

"""

# Distribute
# ==========
# This happens on erilich. We can't make it in place because latex2html barfs on
# dots in the path. So we make it in ~ and then move it into place. We also
# register with PyPI from here. Under Python 2.5 we also have the option to
# upload to PyPI as well.
